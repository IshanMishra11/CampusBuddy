Project Title: Campus Buddy – Your AI Companion for Study & Support

Overview:
This is a student-focused website combining two major features:
1. An AI-powered Study Assistant that helps students quickly understand topics and find curated YouTube playlists.
2. An anonymous Mental Health Support Chatbot that offers emotional support, stress management tips, and positive affirmations.

Target Users:
- College students (especially in my community/college) who need quick revision help or emotional support before exams or during stress periods.

Problem Solved:
1. Students waste time before exams looking for quality study content online.
2. Many students silently struggle with anxiety, stress, or academic burnout and hesitate to talk to someone.

Main Features to Build:
---
1. 📘 **Study Zone**
   - Input box to enter any academic topic.
   - Use Gemini API to generate short, summarized notes.
   - Gemini also gives top 2–3 YouTube video recommendations for that topic.
   - Optionally allow users to save the topic in Firebase Firestore.
   
2. 💬 **Mental Health Zone**
   - Anonymous chat interface (Gemini API backend) for students to talk about their mental state or stress.
   - Gemini offers gentle responses, tips, and support.
   - Option to show a daily positive quote or affirmation on page load.
   - Optionally use local storage to track daily check-ins or mood.

Google Technologies to Integrate:
- Gemini API (for both study assistance and emotional support)
- Firebase Firestore (to store saved study topics if needed)
- Firebase Hosting (for deployment)
- Optional: Firebase Auth (if you want login functionality)

Design Preference:
- Simple, clean, modern UI
- Two main sections: “Study Zone” and “Mental Health Zone”
- Responsive (usable on mobile and laptop)
- Light colors, calming aesthetics, and minimal distractions
